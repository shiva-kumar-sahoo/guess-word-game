# Word Guessing Game

## Overview

The Word Guessing Game is a C++ console application where the player has to guess a randomly selected 5-letter word from a predefined list of words. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the letters in the guessed word are in the correct place, in the word but in the wrong place, or not in the word at all.
